    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>French Toast Casserole offers a delightful twist on the classic breakfast favorite. Slices of 
        bread are soaked in a luscious mixture of eggs, milk, vanilla, and cinnamon, allowing the flavors 
        to meld and infuse into every bite. The soaked bread is then layered in a baking dish and often topped 
        with a sweet and buttery streusel or a drizzle of maple syrup. This casserole is perfect for a leisurely 
        brunch or a special occasion breakfast, as it combines the comforting taste of traditional French toast 
        with the convenience of a casserole, making it easy to serve a crowd. The result is a warm, custardy, 
        and cinnamon-infused treat that captures the essence of a cozy morning meal.</p>
